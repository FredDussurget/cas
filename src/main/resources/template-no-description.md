# What happened? 

The pull request submitted here does not contain an adequate description of changes, or a descriptive title to explain the change request in clear detail. Please be sure to describe the changes you made here in detail and include the problem description, an overview of the solution you made, and whether the change-set presents any side-effects as far as you know. This is both for the benefit of the project maintainers as well as anybody else who might later on stumble upon the pull request.
     
When you prepare the pull request, please make sure your description of the changes follows the rules stated in the pull request template.

A good template to follow when opening pull requests should follow the below *guidelines*:

### Problem

This is where you describe the problem in sufficient detail. Please make sure your pull request has a clear and descriptive title to make it easier for 
others to find and evaluate the change. This is where you begin to explain the use case at hand, and circumstances that led you to it.

Be brief but precise:

- Avoid statements such as *We have X and it doesn’t work*. "It doesn't work" simply doesn’t work.
- Reformulate statements such as *Is it possible to do X?* to explain the why, the what and the how.
                                                                                                       
Then,

- Explain your expected output; what do you expect to happen? What should be the end result in your view?
- Explain the current outcome; what do you see happening today?
- How exactly should one go about reproducing the current outcome? Do you have a series of test cases that demonstrate some faulty behavior? Do you have a sample, a test application to exhibit the issue at hand?

Be sure to describe the environment you have today. What are the key components at play here? What precise version of the software do you run? Where did you 
download it? How old is it and have you considered upgrading? How did you install it? What changes have been applied to the software or its surrounding ecosystem, etc?
 
### Logs

It is important that you provide the full story given to you by log data. You may either attach a clean log file that shows the faulty sequence of operations from start to finish, or (and you should avoid this where you can) you may decide to paste relevant sections of the log although this option is usually risky since the portions you think are relevant may not, in fact, be the entire story. If you do decide to share snippets of logs, remember to not paste the entire log output into a forum or description field, and learn to format and organize the data so it can be easily and readily understood by others quickly.

### Solution

This is where you describe the solution.

- What steps have you taken to identify and diagnose what you consider to be an issue? How far down the rabbit hole have you traveled to debug the code, 
analyze the logs, find comparable solutions and track breaking change and incompatibility across software releases?
- Do you have a solution at hand today that does the job? Have you experimented with code and configuration to determine the root cause and come up with a suggestion on how X may be improved, fixed, etc?

### Testing

This is where you describe steps to reproduce the problem, and how tests remove or mitigate the issue. Please note that your tests need to be entirely automated, and must be in form of a unit, integration or browser test that anybody including the continuous integration system here can run. Descriptive language in the form of *Go here, click this, use that* is quite helpful but not sufficient.

If you believe this message to be an error, please post your explanation here as a comment and it will be reviewed.
