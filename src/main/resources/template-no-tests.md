# What happened?

The patch presented here seems to contain no adequate unit and/or integration tests. Patches that alter CAS core functionality without proper tests, regardless of how small they may seem, are automatically closed. By *tests*, we specifically mean, unit/integration/browser/functional tests; a description and series of instructions on how one may go about reproducing or testing the patch manually is excellent but not sufficient for acceptance. If the change-set here modifies CAS functionality that is extremely and obviously trivial (i.e. fixes a typo) or updates the CAS documentation or presents any other type of change that generally can be accepted without proper tests, please comment and explain on the pull request.

# What's next? 

Please re-open the pull request (or ask project maintainers to do this for you) when you're ready and have included tests to verify functionality. If you feel like you are not immediately available or have no time to work out test cases and steps to reproduce and verify the changes, that's not an issue. Please revisit the pull request as soon as it's convenient for you to resume work as your schedule allows. The pull request will wait for you right here.

If you'd like to keep the patch around and open while you make progress, please mark the patch as `WIP` using one of the following methods:

- Construct your pull request title using the syntax `WIP - <title>` 
- Create the initial pull request in "Draft" status.
       
If you do not know how to write tests, please browse through the resources listed below and get started. If you get stuck, please feel free to ask for help.

Furthermore,

- To learn about CAS test process and how you may design and develop unit/integration tests, please [see this link](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Test-Process.html). If you are unclear on how to write basic unit tests, please [see this link](https://junit.org/).
- See [Contributor Guidelines](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Contributor-Guidelines.html) to learn more about how to contribute to the project and review the criteria that allows for the project to accept contributions.
- If you are seeking assistance and have a question about your CAS deployment, please visit [this page](https://apereo.github.io/cas/Support.html) to learn more about support options.
- If your change-set attempts to solve a problem or defect, be sure to include tests to first and foremost demonstrate the issue. Tests must be able to reproduce the problem **without** changes and fixes first so that project maintainers can ascertain the validity of the issue scenario without resorting to manual steps. Tests and testing done after the fact is not acceptable.
- If your change-set introduces a new CAS feature or improvement, please consider starting discussion with the project to see if your patch can be accepted and maintained by project owners and maintainers. Unless your change is extremely trivial and has been through proper review and is sponsored by a project maintainer, please do not spend time modifying code and configuration in a proposed pull request. 

If you believe this message to be an error, please post your explanation here as a comment and it will be reviewed.
